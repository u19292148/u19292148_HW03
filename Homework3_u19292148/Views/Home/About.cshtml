                <h4>My BIO</h4>
                <p>
                    I was born on 25 April 2000. I went to Pierneef primary and Hendrik Verwoerd High School.
                    My love for technology started at a young age. There are so many degrees you can study to become a programmer that I decided to take
                    a gap year after grade 12. I studied Bsc Information and knowledge system in 2020 but I realised I like the Informatics
                    subject more so in 2021 I swaped over to BIT Information Systems.
